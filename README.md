## Summary of Analysis

As indicated by the results of the analysis above, the total fares for the Rural and Suburban markets are considerably lower than in the Urban markets. Here are a few recommendations to increase revenue.

- Decrease the cost of rides in the Suburban and Rural markets to encourage more consumers to use the PyBer service.
- Increase the amount of drivers in the Suburban and Rural markets to reduce wait time. This should also increase the amount of rides in these markets.
- Increase the cost of rides in the Urban market. The total rides in the Urban market is considerably larger than in the other markets and a small increase in the cost per ride could pay huge dividends!
